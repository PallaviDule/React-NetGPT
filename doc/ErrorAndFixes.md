### Issue 1: Page reloads with /? on button click
- **Problem**:  
When clicking a `<button>` in my React component form, the app was unexpectedly reloading and redirecting to: `http://localhost:3000/?`. This was happening every time I clicked the button â€” even though I just wanted to trigger a function.
- **Cause**:    
Using `<button>` without specifying a type defaults to `type="submit"`, which triggers a form submission and causes a page reload.
- **Fix**:  
    1. Recommended : Set the button type explicitly to prevent reload:   
    `<button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>`
    2. Alternative: Use event.preventDefault()  
        ```js
        const handleClick = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault(); // Stops form submission
        console.log('clicked!');
        };

        <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        ```
        This works but adds extra logic to the handler. Better suited when you're inside a <form> and want more nuanced control (e.g., validation before submit)
